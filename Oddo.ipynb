You can add new fields, override existing methods, and add new methods in the inherited class. Class inheritance is represented by the inherit attribute in the class definition. It is denoted by class NewClass(ExistingClass):.\n",

    "2-Prototype Inheritance: Prototype inheritance allows you to define a prototype model and create new models that inherit the fields and behavior of the prototype model. The prototype model acts as a template, and any modification made to the prototype model is automatically reflected in all the inherited models. Prototype inheritance is useful when you want to create multiple similar models with shared fields and behavior. Prototype inheritance is represented by the __prototype attribute in the class definition. It is denoted by class NewModel(models.Model): __name__ = 'new.model' __inherits__ = {'prototype.model': 'prototype_id'}.\n",

    "3-Mixin Inheritance: Mixin inheritance allows you to define reusable sets of fields and methods that can be mixed into multiple models. It is used when you want to add common functionality to multiple models without creating a new model hierarchy. Mixins are defined as separate classes and can be mixed into other models using the mixins attribute in the class definition. Mixin inheritance is denoted by class MixinClass(models.AbstractModel): and can be mixed into other models using the mixins attribute, like class NewModel(models.Model): mixins = ['module.mixin']."

    "\n",
    "Referencing Fields: Instead of hard-coding field names in views, you can use external IDs to reference fields. This ensures that the view continues to work correctly even if the field name changes. For example:\n",

Wizards provide a step-by-step approach, allowing users to input data or make selections before executing an action. Wizards can be triggered from various contexts, such as buttons, menu items, or automated workflows.

They can be used for various purposes such as invoices, sales orders, purchase orders, and financial statements. Reports can include tables, charts, images, and other elements to present the data in a structured manner. Odoo provides a powerful reporting engine that supports different types of reports, including PDF, Excel, HTML, and others. Reports in Odoo can be defined using the QWeb templating language and can be triggered from menu items, buttons, or automated actions.\n",

    "Actions: Actions in Odoo define the behavior and interactions associated with user interactions, such as button clicks or menu selections. They specify what should happen when a user performs a certain action. Actions can include opening a view, executing a server action, running a report, launching a wizard, or performing other operations. Actions serve as the bridge between user interactions and the underlying system functionalities. They are defined as records in the database and can be associated with menu items, buttons, or other UI elements in Odoo. Actions can be configured to trigger specific views, set default values, pass context, and control the flow of the application.\n",

    "1. **Models**: Models define the structure and behavior of the data stored in the database. They are defined as Python classes that inherit from the base Odoo models, such as `models.Model`, `models.TransientModel`, or other specialized models. Models define fields, methods, constraints, and other aspects of data management and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Views**: Views define the user interface and how data is presented to users. They are defined using XML and specify the structure, layout, and widgets used to display data. Views can be of different types, such as form views, tree views, search views, kanban views, and calendar views. They are associated with models and control the interaction and visualization of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Security Rules**: Security rules define access rights and permissions for different user roles. They are used to restrict or grant access to specific models, fields, or actions based on certain conditions. Security rules ensure that data is securely managed and accessed by authorized users.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Menus and Actions**: Menus define the navigation structure of the module and how its functionality is accessed from the user interface. Menus can be organized into hierarchical structures and linked to actions, which represent specific operations or workflows within the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Workflows**: Workflows define the sequence of steps or states that an object or record can go through during its lifecycle. Workflows specify the possible transitions, conditions, and actions associated with each state change. They are used to automate and control business processes within the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reports**: Reports define the templates and layouts for generating formatted documents or outputs based on data from the module. Reports can be of various types, such as PDF, Excel, HTML, or others, and they present data in a structured manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tests**: Tests are used to ensure the quality and correctness of the module's code. They include unit tests, functional tests, and other types of tests that validate the module's behavior and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the main components that make up the composition or structure of an Odoo module in version 16. Following this structure ensures proper organization, maintainability, and extensibility of the module within the Odoo framework."

    "\n",
    "Method Overloading:\n",
    "Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a class. The methods must have different parameter lists, which can vary in terms of the number of parameters, their types, or both. The compiler or runtime determines which method to execute based on the arguments passed during the method invocation.\n",

    "Method Overriding:\n",
    "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class. By overriding the method, the subclass can change the behavior of the method to suit its specific needs.\n",

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes. It enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where a subclass (or derived class) inherits the properties and methods of a superclass (or base class). The subclass can then extend or modify the inherited attributes and behaviors, as well as add its own unique characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are key points about inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Superclass and Subclass: Inheritance involves two main entities: the superclass (also called the base class or parent class) and the subclass (also called the derived class or child class). The superclass serves as the template or blueprint, and the subclass inherits its properties and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing subclasses to inherit and reuse the attributes and methods defined in the superclass. This avoids redundant code and promotes a more efficient and maintainable codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inherited and Added Features: The subclass inherits both the public and protected attributes and methods of the superclass. It can directly use and access these inherited features. Additionally, the subclass can add new attributes and methods or modify the inherited ones to suit its specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding: Inheritance also allows for method overriding, where the subclass provides its own implementation of a method inherited from the superclass. This enables the subclass to change the behavior of the method while keeping the same method signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance Hierarchies: Inheritance can create a hierarchy of classes with multiple levels of inheritance. A subclass can become a superclass for another subclass, forming a chain of inheritance relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modifiers: In many programming languages, access modifiers (such as public, protected, and private) control the visibility and accessibility of attributes and methods. Subclasses can often access the protected and public members of their superclass."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "Lists and tuples are both data structures in Python used to store collections of items. While they share some similarities, there are key differences between them. Here are the main distinctions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutability:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified. You can add, remove, or change elements within a list.\n",
    "   - Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified. It provides a fixed collection of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Lists are defined using square brackets (`[]`). Elements are separated by commas.\n",
    "   - Tuples are defined using parentheses (`()`). Elements are also separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Usage and Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Lists are commonly used when you need a collection of items that may change over time. They are suitable for scenarios where you want to add, remove, or modify elements dynamically.\n",
    "   - Tuples are often used when you want to store a collection of related values that should remain constant. They are useful for representing fixed data structures or when you want to ensure the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Tuples are generally more efficient in terms of memory and performance compared to lists. Since tuples are immutable, they require less memory and offer faster access to elements.\n",
    "   - Lists require more memory due to their mutable nature and involve additional overhead for maintaining their dynamic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Lists are suitable for scenarios such as maintaining a list of user inputs, managing a queue or stack, storing a sequence of items, or when you need to modify the collection.\n",
    "   - Tuples are often used for returning multiple values from a function, representing coordinates or points, creating dictionary keys, or when you want to ensure data integrity in a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to choose between lists and tuples based on your specific requirements. If you need a collection that can be modified, use a list. If you need an immutable collection or want to ensure data integrity, use a tuple."
